        Hello, and welcome to my little corner of the internet. You might be wondering "just who the heck is this guy?" or maybe you just want a little more context about what makes me such an awesome person. Well you've come to the right place. I'm Robert Russell Stauss, but you can just call me Bob, and as the header hints at I'm a professional web developer. This wasn't always the case though. If you don't want to read through my life story <a href="#programming-blurb">click here</a> to jump to the section where I talk about becoming a programmer, or if you want something even more cut and dry you can <a href="/current-stauss-resume.pdf" download>click here to download my resume.</a>

      <div id="about" className="text-block">
        <p>Born and raised in central Vermont, I grew up on the family farm, and was always interested in mythology and art. I spent my childhood out in the woods, exploring, playing, and building little forts. Despite the blood feuds with a couple of the redneck families in the area it was a good childhood, and I can boast that I went to the longest continuously running one-room schoolhouse in the country (which has sadly shut down now). I also started running lights and sound for a little local theater called <a href="https://www.phantomtheater.org/" target="_blank" rel="norefferer">Phantom</a>, which I am now the technical director of, more than 15 years later.</p>
        <p>In college I studied mythology and art. I got really good at research, and decently competent at painting, drawing, and sculpting, and then I realized that I'd need another 5-10 years of school before I could actually do anything with my degrees. So I took a hard pivot, put my research skills to good use, and landed an internship at a private investigators office. Unfortunately it was an <em>unpaid</em> internship so I had to find something to put food on the table. Thus began my foray into restaurant work. It was challenging, stressful, and thoroughly unpleasant, but I grew as a person, and learned many soft skills, such as how to work as part of a larger team, how to batch and prioritize tasks, customer service skills, and how to make a really good sandwich. In the middle of my restaurant days I moved out to Utah for 1. cheap rent, and 2. great skiing. These were the dark days, but lead me to where I am now.</p>
        <p>In Utah I continued with the restaurant work, but I also picked up a job as a ski instructor. I could work a job I didn't hate! This was a revelation for me. The days were long, and the work wasn't always engaging (you can only ski the bunny slope so many times before it gets a little old) but the work felt meaningful, and during breaks I could ski wherever I wanted. I was still barely making enough to scrape by, but I was happier than I'd been in a good long while. When I moved back to Vermont that spring (Utah summers are too hot, I was there for one, and couldn't do another) I knew I couldn't go back to working in restaurants so I started to look for something that would not only feed my body, but also my soul, and this is how I stumbled upon the Burlington Code Academy.</p>
